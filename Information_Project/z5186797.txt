20/09/20|15:30|21:30|start research for project and practice for react|
We started comp9900 project for this term.
This week, we met up each other and discussed which topic we want to choose.
Seems moviefinder is relatively easier to attach for everyone so
we will choose this topic.
I will do front-end for this project so from last week I've study React for JavaScript.
React is JS new library and this is famous for making web application with clear and beautiful UI.
(if react starts , it will make basic html and css automatically.)
Studied using this react official website,
https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-are-we-building
I felt a little difficult to understand render() and props for react syntax,
but actually I found render() is just function which return html tags
and props is just argv... for c++.
This week, my purpose is making really simple web application (like this https://react.rocks/tag/Movies)
for trial for react and write proposal such as user stories.
-------------------------------------------------------------
27/09/20|start to use Jira and design UI for proposal|
Week2 started, we chose Moviefinder project and start to write proposal.
Since it is recommended to use Jira so we make user stories and later
scrum master groups them and we can attach our own tasks.
I'm in charge of UI so use draw.io and start design UI.
I referred these websites https://letterboxd.com/, https://codepen.io/studiojvla/full/zBQAWo,
https://www.amazon.co.jp/, https://www.amazon.co.au/ and
completed 75% of design.
-------------------------------------------------------------
03/10/20|finished design UI and start study for Django|
Week3 started, this week I worked for mainly finishing UI design.
For API, I met Luyuan(z5247759) and discussed about which API we should use mainly.
We concluded that we use Django for first step since our team member all know how to
use python and it is better to use one API for ease for everyone(not use
React and Django both). Maybe if we have time, we can use React to make
more functional website in week8 or 9.
So, I stated to study Django watching this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjAMRnCu-84&start=0s
and tutorials website https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/.
Maybe next week, I can make simple main website which show movie details and login page.
-------------------------------------------------------------
11/10/20|study Django and make simple UI|
in Week4 our purpose is to make simple UI for demonstration for week5.
So far, our movie database has movieID, title, genres, directors, year, CoverURL
but we need to store plot story and casts so
made make_small_db.py to store data (the number of movie we can assign).
For review, maybe we can make many to many table to store UserID (primary key), MovieID or name (primary key), review contents .
I worked to make UI but didn't use template , so just
put for loop to show each movie, but after I saw Luyuan's UI
his one was more beautiful so it is better to use his UI for this.
-------------------------------------------------------------
18/10/20|Write Code and do demo|
in week5, we have already made simple UI and simple feature for movie finder.
I worked on index.page and made genre filter so if user choose specific genre
it can display only this specific genres. It is easy to make this function since
need to edit view.py and add new select sentence for movie database
(such as objects.filter(genres__contains=genre)).
The a little complicated point is need to merge pagination and this function.
So, I made query_string and pass this to html (frontend).
We can use this feature for display be rating as well later.
We did demo on Thursday , I think we have been doing good job for this project.
-------------------------------------------------------------
26/10/20|Write Code|
in week 6 we have flexible week so we do not have lab ,
we discussed about which point we can improve from demo and
start write retrospectives. After that we assigned work for each member
and I made directors page to show every directors and made
drop down button since in last demo tutor point out a little many information on
UI. I almost finished and now need to clean UI and display each directors align line.
Still, it has bug which even directors has no movies to make but show all movies , need to
fix it later.
-------------------------------------------------------------
03/11/20|Compose structure and Write Code for recommendation system|
in week 7 it is close to end of this project , so after we did meeting on Monday
we decided to attach difficult part of this projects which are recommendation system and
user ban list. I finished my work to make browser by genre and directors and directors page
so I started to consider component of recommendation system and write code.
First I made recommendation system by director and this is relatively easier Since
need to get movies which same director directed.
For recommendation by genre, it is a bit complicated because each movie has more than
one feature so I used count-vector and calculate similarity for each movie using genres feature.
These recommendation systems seem work so I start to think about how to make the system
by review history. My idea is that "if current user is user U1, and user U1 rated the current movie M1
rating 4, Then User U2 also rated M1 a 4. Finally, U2 also rated movie M2 a 4. Hence, we recommend U1
the movie M2". I will implement this idea in following weeks.
-------------------------------------------------------------
09/11/20|improve UI and recommendation system|
in week 8, we have almost finished making feature of out movie finder web application.
We presented demo in this week lab and I feel we have implemented better demo compared to last time
since we already made UI much clearer and almost implemented many feature.
Seems rating has some trouble with their structure how to store data but Luyuan did a great job for this
so already solved . I also worked into improvement of recommendation system so
made user based system and mix with genres, casts, directors which user can choose from tab.
For casts, first I tried to use similarity as same as genres but casts has too many person name so
I found that count vector is not working well for this category .
Therefore I used default dictionary to store the number of same cast for each movie,
as a result it worked well compared to using similarity so I chose this method for cast recommendation.
-------------------------------------------------------------
16/11/20|Debug and fix bug and write report|
in week 9, we decided to focus on writing a final report and fixing some small bug in code since
submit due day is Next Monday. We found that all directors page is a little messy so
I implemented to make line to separate all directors name into section of each first alphabet of name.
For report , I'm charge of writing description of challenge or trick data structure part
so I just looked up my code ( recommendation part ) and average rating calculation part then
wrote description of these components.
-------------------------------------------------------------
20/11/20|Final Diary|
in week10, finally we finish our project and we have done the final presentation.
Before that, we all implemented practice for final demo on Tuesday and Thursday morning.
I think all of us did a great job and feel I could learn some skills to make web application
especially in the part how to connect frontend and backend.
Thank you for all member for this projects.
