Hashing is a common method used to uniquely identify malware. 
The malicious software is run through a hashing program that produces a unique hash that identifies that malware (a sort of fingerprint). 
The Message-Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) hash function is the one most commonly used for malware analysis, though the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) is also popular.

A hash value is a CheckSum value.  It is a mathematical representation of a binary.  Supposedly each file will have a unique checksum value.  Thus a checksum value can be used to represent a particular file.  If a File Infecting Virus alters a given binary, the Checksum value for that binary will change.A hash Table is basically a library of CheckSum values.  An algorithm is used to generate a CheckSum value and it is them compared to the values in said library.
