gets is dangerous just read top of stack

64*a + address
C buf[5] 4 data + NULL terminator


Why bufferoverfolow happen !!??

well, caz we need buffer for write(or read) some in memory but
if not buffer allowcated they can occur segmantion fault 
but if there are othre buffer beyond one buffer 
they can over write overflow

This is buffer overflow 
buffer1↓
buffer2

if this 
buffer1↓
other memory segment

segmention fault  !!!
